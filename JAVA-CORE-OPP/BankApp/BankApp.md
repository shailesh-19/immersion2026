# Java OOP Project: Bank Transaction Management System

## Problem Statement

A bank wants to automate its daily customer transactions through a console-based application. Currently, customers must visit the bank branch or contact customer support to know their account balance and perform fund transfers. To improve customer convenience and reduce manual work, the bank has decided to develop a Java application using Object-Oriented Programming principles.

The application should maintain customer account information and provide basic banking services such as checking account balance and transferring money between accounts.

Each customer account should have details such as account number, account holder name, account type, and account balance.

The system must allow customers to:

* View the balance of a specific account.
* Transfer money from one account to another account.

Before a transfer is performed, the application must validate the transaction according to banking rules.

### Conditions for Successful Transfer

1. The sender account number must exist.
2. The receiver account number must exist.
3. Transfer amount must be greater than zero.
4. Sender account must have sufficient balance.
5. The transfer should update both account balances correctly.
6. Appropriate success or error messages should be displayed.

The application should be developed using classes, objects, constructors, encapsulation, and object interaction.
